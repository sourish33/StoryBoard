# StoryBoard

StoryBoard is an application where users can create and share short stories. Once signed in (either through Google or by username and password), users can create or update (or delete) their profile. They can also create stories and optionally make them public. Users can read public stories shared by other users, view profiles of other users and also like and save stories.  

Admin users can view, edit or delete all stories.
